## Center of Mass Imaging CTF

- iCOM CTF is given by the complex-probe autocorrelation function:

:::{math}
:label: icom_ctf_eq
\mathrm{Im}\left\{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{iCOM}}(\bm{q})\right\} = \left[\psi \star \psi \right](\bm{q}).

Effect of various aberrations on the iCoM CTF.
The resulting CTF is shown on the left panel, radial average in the middle panel, and effect on weak phase object in the right panel.
