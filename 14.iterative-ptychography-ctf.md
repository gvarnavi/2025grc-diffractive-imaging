## Iterative Ptychography CTF

- The iterative nature of ptychography precludes analytical CTF expressions
  - Instead, we use a numerical scheme to estimate the transfer of information

Effect of various aberrations on the iterative ptychography CTF.
The resulting CTF is shown on the left panel, radial average in the middle panel, and effect on weak phase object in the right panel.
